## Abstract

Define and implement a Pact interface to provide a non-fungible coin or token standard, drawing inspiration
from ERC-721 and related token standards.


## Motivation

The outstanding motivation at time of writing is to ensure interoperability between the Kadena token,
as implemented in the "coin contract", and non-fungible tokens that will exist on the system.

It will follow the standard set forth in fungible-v2 (KIP-0005) but for non-divisible token architecture

Otherwise, ERC-721 and related standards have proved their worth many times over. However Pact has
it's own way of doing things and `non-fungible` reflects that.

## Rationale

### Not including `totalSupply`
This can be specified in a separate interface, but for the coin contract, this is an expensive feature
that is unnecessary for runtime operation, and is better handled by off-chain market data.

### Non-Divisible
The `non-fungible` tokens emitted by this smart contract standard will be unique, non-divisible, and cannot be traded amongst each other for equal value.

### No metadata
Things like `name`, `symbol` and other asset metadata are not relevant here.

### On-behalf-of not specified.
As noted above, managed capabilities allow for safe inter-contract transfer within a single transaction.
This addresses one need of on-behalf-of in a single transaction.

The ability to lock up an amount for another party in a later transaction is not specified.
This can be easily achieved by creating dedicated escrow accounts with multisig and/or a user guard
if features like timeouts are desired.

### Transfer restrictions not specified

Whitelisting/blacklisting and other security token standards are not specified.


## Backwards Compatibility

N/A

## Specification
